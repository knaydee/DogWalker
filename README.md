# DogWalker
A draft app to connect dog owners with dog walkers.

As of 12/17, I have two models - one for users, that manages the login process, and one for owners. I still need to build out the model for dog walkers. After you create an account by adding your username and password, you're prompted to select whether you're a dog owner that wants to find someone to walk their dog, or someone that wants to walk dogs. Only the "I'm a dog owner!" link works.

By Sunday, 12/20, I will have built out the dog walker model, which will allow me to more thoroughly review the site and create more issues if others are interested in participating in this app. Stay tuned for more issues, my fellow Ada students!

The current workflow of the app is such:

Once you create an account, you're prompted to fill in more information about yourself (i.e. a short bio about what kind of dog walker / dog owner you're looking for). Then, you're directed to your respective home page. Eventually, this home page will show the most recent new users that have been added to the site. If you're a dog owner, it will show dog walkers who have recently created an account (and vice versa for dog walkers).

Currently, after you fill in your bio, I have an error that does not direct you to this home page. I will also have this fixed by Sunday, 12/20. 

My stretch goal is to add a gem that will allow users to message one another internally.

A further stretch goal is to add a calendar feature that shows when a dog walker is available or when a dog owner needs his/her pet walked.
